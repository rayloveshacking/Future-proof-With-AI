# Futureproof with AI üöÄ

**Hackathon Submission:** AisP Cyber & AI Hackathon

## Inspiration & Problem Statement ü§î

The rise of Artificial Intelligence is transforming industries, creating a demand for professionals who can leverage AI alongside their core skills. However, students often struggle to:

1.  Understand which AI skills are relevant to their desired career paths.
2.  Develop a clear roadmap to acquire these skills.
3.  Showcase their AI-enhanced capabilities effectively to potential employers.

Simultaneously, recruiters face challenges in identifying candidates who possess the right blend of domain expertise and practical AI knowledge.

**Futureproof with AI** aims to bridge this gap, empowering students to navigate the AI-driven job market and connecting recruiters with the next generation of AI-savvy talent.
